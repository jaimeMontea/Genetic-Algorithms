# Genetic-Algorithms

These are some examples of genetic algorithms of the book "Genetic Algorithms with Python" by Clinton Sheppard.

Genetic algorithms are one of the tools we can use to apply machine learning to finding good, sometimes even optimal, solutions to problems that have billions of potential solutions. They use biological processes in software to find answers to problems that have really large search spaces by continuously generating candidate solutions, evaluating how well the solutions fit the desired outcome, and refining the best solutions.

When solving a problem with a genetic algorithm, instead of asking for a specific solution, you provide characteristics that the solution must have or rules its solution must pass to be accepted. For example, when filling a moving truck you provide a set of rules like: load big things first, distribute the weight to both sides, put light things on top but not loose, interlock things with odd shapes so they donâ€™t move around. The more constraints you add the more potential solutions are blocked. Suppose you say: put the refrigerator, washer and dryer along the front left wall, load boxes of books along the front right wall, mattresses down the middle, and clothes on top of the mattresses.
